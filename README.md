This repository serves educational purposes for the Department of Physics at the University of Colombo. We cover various topics related to C programming through this repository.

C is a low-level programming language, offering a high degree of control over hardware resources. This capability enables programmers to develop highly efficient and fast programs.
C programs are compiled directly into machine code, producing executable files that are highly optimized for the target architecture.

One of the main advantage of C programming language is C can be employed for writing parallel programs using libraries like OpenMP or MPI. This is important in scientific computing, where parallelism is often used to accelerate computations.
