# Introduction to Data Types:

In C programming, data types specify the type of data a variable can hold. C supports various data types, categorized into basic types and derived types. Some of them are 
- **int**: Represents integers (whole numbers)
- **long**: Represents integers with a larger range than the standard int data type.
- **float**: Represents floating-point numbers (decimal numbers).
- **double**: Similar to float but with double precision.
- **char**:Represents single characters.

The following example shows how to use **int** and **long** data types. Assume that the file is named as numbers.c. 
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int mass = 25;
    long distance = 1000000;
    printf("Mass: %d in kg\n", age);
    printf("Distance: %d in m\n", age);
    return 0;
}
```
 You can run the above code using a Linux terminal and GCC as follows.
```bash
gcc -o num numbers.c
./num
```
