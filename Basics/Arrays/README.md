# Introduction to Arrays

An array in C is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element is identified by its index or position within the array.

### Declaration:
```C
int numbers[5]; // Declares an integer array with 5 elements
```

### Initialization:
```C
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initializes an integer array during declaration
```
### Accessing Elements:
```C
int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Accesses the first element (index 0)
int thirdNumber = numbers[2]; // Accesses the third element (index 2)

```
