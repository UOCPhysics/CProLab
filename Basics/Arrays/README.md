# Introduction to Arrays

An array in C is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element is identified by its index or position within the array.

###Declaration:
```C
int numbers[5]; // Declares an integer array with 5 elements
```

###Initialization:
```C
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initializes an integer array during declaration
```
###Accessing Elements:
```C
printf("First element: %d\n", numbers[0]); // Accesses the first element of the array

```
